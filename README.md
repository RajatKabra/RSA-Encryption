# RSA-Encryption

The objective of the project is to exploit the vulnerability in the RSA cryptosystem, when the prime factors used by the system are close to each other by value. The project has implemented the RSA cryptosystem and has devised an RSA Key Factorization attack that will deduce the RSA private key value -d, from the RSA public key parameters -N, e.
